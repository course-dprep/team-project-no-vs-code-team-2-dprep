## IMDb – Title project 
This project researches if there is a correlation between the runtime of a movie and its IMDb rating. We focus on different genres to find out if big differences in runtime can rating can be found. This result can help filmmakers in deciding how long their films should be. 

### Research Motivation 
The research question—exploring whether there is a correlation between movie runtime and IMDb rating with a specific focus on genre—is clearly articulated and of significant importance. This inquiry delves into understanding how different genres come with distinct audience expectations. Filmmakers often face tough decisions about how long their films should be. A longer runtime allows for more detailed storytelling, character development, and complex narratives, but it may also test the audience's patience. On the other hand, shorter films might be more accessible and appealing to time-constrained viewers but could risk feeling rushed or underdeveloped. 

To expand on why the correlation between movie runtime and IMDb rating might differ by genre, consider how different genres have unique storytelling conventions and audience expectations. For example, epic dramas or fantasy films often require longer runtimes to build complex worlds, develop multi-layered characters, and weave intricate plots. In contrast, comedies or action films tend to have shorter runtimes, focusing on pacing and delivering quick entertainment. Therefore, what works for one genre may not work for another, and the audience's tolerance for length can vary depending on these genre conventions.

By examining how runtime impacts ratings within specific genres, this research can provide valuable insights into audience preferences. Directors can benefit from understanding whether a tight, concise runtime is more effective for genres like horror, or if extending the runtime enhances character development in dramas.
