#1.1
# Research Question 
##Is there a correlation between a movie's runtime and its IMDb rating, with a focus on genre?

# Research motivation
##The research question—exploring whether there is a correlation between movie runtime and IMDb rating with a specific focus on genre—is clearly articulated and of significant importance. This inquiry delves into understanding how different genres come with distinct audience expectations. Filmmakers often face tough decisions about how long their films should be. A longer runtime allows for more detailed storytelling, character development, and complex narratives, but it may also test the audience's patience. On the other hand, shorter films might be more accessible and appealing to time-constrained viewers but could risk feeling rushed or underdeveloped. By examining how runtime impacts ratings within specific genres, this research can provide valuable insights into audience preferences.

##The choice of research method, specifically regression analysis, is well-motivated. It allows for a nuanced exploration of how runtime correlates with ratings, while controlling for genre, to isolate the effects specific to different types of films. This approach not only highlights the relationship between runtime and audience satisfaction but also offers data-driven guidance for filmmakers. Directors can benefit from understanding whether a tight, concise runtime is more effective for genres like horror, or if extending the runtime enhances character development in dramas.
